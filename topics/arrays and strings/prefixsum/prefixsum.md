# Prefix Sum  
Prefix sum is a technique that can be used on an array of numbers. The main idea is to create a prefix where prefix[i] is the sum of all elements up to the index i (inclusive). 

# Pre-processing 
Building a prefix sum is a form of pre-processing. Essentially, we are storing pre-computed data before running the main logic of our algorithm. This is an investment that will save us time during the execution of the main parts of the algorithm.
